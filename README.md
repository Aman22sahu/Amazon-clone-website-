# Amazon-clone-website 
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed as a part of my learning journey to practice and strengthen my web development skills. The project replicates the layout and design of the Amazon website, including its responsive structure, navigation bar, product sections, and footer. By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating structured, visually appealing, and user-friendly interfaces that work across different devices and screen sizes.

✅ Key Features

1)Fully Responsive Design: The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops, ensuring a consistent user experience across all devices.

2)Navigation Bar: Includes the Amazon logo, a fully styled search bar, and a shopping cart icon — designed to resemble the actual Amazon navigation header.

3)Hero Banner Section: A large, attractive banner is placed at the top to highlight promotional content, similar to the real Amazon site.

4)Product Display Grid: Products are shown in a neat grid format with images, names, and pricing details. Each product card is styled for consistency and visual appeal.

5)Category Sections: Multiple product categories are displayed in different rows to mimic Amazon’s homepage structure, making the layout more realistic and dynamic.

6)Footer Section: Contains helpful links and information typically found at the bottom of e-commerce websites, adding completeness to the page.

7)Clean and Maintainable Code: The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are well-structured and organized, making it easy to read, update, or scale the project in the future.
